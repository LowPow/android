public [Unit](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html)[close](close.md)()

Closes this output stream and releases any system resources associated with this stream. The general contract of `close` is that it closes the output stream. A closed stream cannot perform output operations and cannot be reopened.
